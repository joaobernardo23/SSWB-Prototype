# Code
For now the `frontend.py` code is not being used to control the compactor because everyting is performed with the Arduino Serial connection. A future simple modification can change this and include the GUI to control the compactor.
Therefore, the project is, for now, solely contained in the `main` folder with the `main.ino` script.
